@par Example Description 

The Mass Storage example gives a typical example of how to use the STM32F072 USB device 
peripheral to communicate with a PC Host using the bulk transfer while the microSD
card is used as storage media.

This example supports the BOT (bulk only transfer) protocol and all needed SCSI
(small computer system interface) commands, and is compatible with Windows platform.

After running the example, the user just has to plug the USB cable into a PC host
and the device is automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the
system window and write/read/format operations can be performed as with any other
removable drive.


@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example runs on STM32F072xB devices
   - This example has been tested with STM32072B-EVAL and can be easily tailored
     to any other supported device and development board.

   - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
       - Use CN4 connector to connect the board to a PC host through USB cable
       - Insert the MicroSD card in the CN9 connector (right side of the board).
